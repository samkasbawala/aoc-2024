# Advent of Code 2024

This is my attempt at completing [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024).
Let's see how far I can get this year.

## Running Locally

Trying out [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) this year because why not.
Start by [installing that first](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).
Then clone this repository.

### Install Dependencies

```
poetry install
```

### Run Tests

```
poetry run pytest .
```

### Format

```
poetry run black .
```

### MyPy

```
poetry run mypy .
```

### Solving Your Prompts

Replace the contents of `day*/input.txt` with your personalized input for the problem.
Then run that day's problem as a script.
The answer will print out in the terminal.

```
python day01/part1.py
```
